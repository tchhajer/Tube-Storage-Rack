## Key Contributions
- **Custom rack design** to hold varying lengths of tubes vertically.
- **Lean 5S integration**: Contributed to a broader Lean initiative to streamline workplace layout and reduce wasted motion.
- **Improved accessibility**: Operators can now access materials more quickly and with less effort.
- **Fabrication-ready CAD model** created and implemented.

## Impact
- Freed up critical **floor space**.
- Boosted **operator efficiency** and **safety**.
- Helped sustain a more **organized work environment**.

## Tools & Technologies
- SolidWorks (CAD design)
- Steel fabrication
- Lean 5S principles
